Code to Generate Script for IC SynthLogo

The entire SynthLogo dataset is too large to be uploaded to Github, thus we provide code which can generate the entire 28000+ Images and their corresponging annotations from the support datasets

This repository contains the following support dataset to generate the synthetic IC images:
Original scraped Logos in Logos Folder
Cropped logos in sorted-logos-test folder
PCB Images to with real IC images to implant in pcb_images folder

Generating the dataset can be run from the folder using the overlap.py file

If you need just the dataset, with the images and annotations, please visit : https://www.trust-hub.org/#/data
